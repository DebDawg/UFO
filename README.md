# UFO Data

## Overview of the Analysis:
Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS we are using to create a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter Dana's data by Date, City, State, Country or Shape of the Object.  They can filter by 1 or all 5 of the searchs.

## Results:
Using the "Filter Search" options on the Webpage, users can access data by entering either the date, city, state, country or shape. The results of the search will appear in the table on the page.

## Summary:
Once the webpage and Table were created, I did notice one drawback was having to refresh the page for each search is sort of a drag.

## Recommendations:
1. Add a drop down menu for each search engine for the dates and cities.
2. Maybe add a user comments section based on sited location, users that either witnessed the sighting or have additional information.
